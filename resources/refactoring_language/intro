Software ecosystems consist of software projects that are
developed and evolve together in a shared environment [13].
Research on such ecosystems only recently emerged within
software engineering [15]. It addresses, among other things,
the analysis of the characteristics and evolution of software
ecosystems, which some researchers consider to be a central
subject in this field of research [26]

Software ecosystems are environments that form as projects evolve in parallel,
becoming interconnected as contexts and dependencies span companies and communities [13]. 
Research on these systems has increased rapidly in the recent past [new], investigating
their characteristics and behaviour as they develop [14]. Understanding how software
ecosystems form and change is valuable from both a software as well as a business standpoint [15],
and is important for informing developers how technologies are used over time [26]. 
An understanding of software ecosystems can inform decisions on when to adopt frameworks and how long
to support them, as well as provide insight into how changes to software propagate throughout the community [wittern].




. To that regard, some
software ecosystems have been scientifically assessed, including the Maven [23], Apache [2], Gentoo [4], Ruby [11], and
R [8] ecosystems. Nonetheless, a systematic literature study
from 2013 found that research regarding real-world software
ecosystems is lacking [14].
The study of characteristics and the evolution of software
ecosystems is an end in itself, allowing to understand how
certain technologies spread or why others fail. In addition,
this research can also inform the design of new ecosystems
and associated tooling, including technical as well as social
aspects [26]. Furthermore, as software projects are seldom
created in isolation, studying individual software projects
often requires studying the ecosystem around them [3].
The node package manager (npm) combines a set of open
source tools that developers use to describe their JavaScript
packages, and specifically Node.js packages. These tools include, for example, a command line interface to create and
maintain package.json files, which declare, among other
things, the name, description, version, and dependencies of
a package. npm furthermore features a registry that developers can use to publish their packages, making them available
for others to use. Packages within npm may depend on each
other, and software projects outside of npm, for example applications, may specify dependencies to packages hosted on
npm. Since its creation in 2009, npm has grown rapidly to now
feature over 230, 000 packages (as of January 28th, 2016).
npm provides a complete set of various historic data points
on the packages in the ecosystem. This data thus not only
provides insights into the current state of the ecosystem, but
also into how the ecosystem evolved over time. The diversity
of available data points furthermore allows us to assess the
ecosystem from multiple perspectives and to compare these
perspectives. Understanding npm provides valuable insights
into the rapid growth JavaScript and Node.js experienced
within the last years. It also helps to understand how individual packages rose in popularity, prevailed, and sometimes
were eventually replaced or disregarded.
